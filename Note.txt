Go data type
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/go_data_types.htm

In Go, slices is list (dynamic array)


When there are multiple go files it needs to run all the related files e.g.
go run main2.go helper.go

Alternatively, it can be run in the folder
go run .

To export the fuctions and variables, the first char of the functions and variables must be capitalized.

Variables 3 scopes
- local -> in a function -> can be used within a function/scope
- package -> in a package -> can be used everywhere in the same package. Example is in main2.go
  var conferenceName string = "Go Conference"
  var remainingTickets uint = conferenceTickets
  var bookings []string

- global -> start with a capitalized letter. -> can be accessed everywhere
  var MyVar string = "My value"


- Concurrency

WaitGroup
var wg = sync.WaitGroup{}

wg.Add(1)
go functionName


wg.Wait()
wg.Done()
